\newpage

## Objectives

- Scrape fighter statistics and match history from UFCStats.com  
- Clean and organize the dataset for analysis  
- Explore trends such as fight frequency, win methods, and striking patterns

\newpage

## Deliverables

- A clean and structured dataset of UFC fights  
- Visual analysis revealing:
  - Top fighters by performance  
  - Average fight duration across weight classes  
  - Most common win methods (KO, submission, decision)  
  - Key trends with actionable insights and visualizations

# Conclusion

The UFC fight data reveals key patterns in modern MMA competition. Most fights are won by decision, suggesting a focus on endurance and point scoring over risky knockouts. Heavier fighters tend to end bouts faster, while lighter classes show longer, more technical matches. Veteran fighters dominate in total strikes, highlighting experience as a critical factor. Finally, the frequency of UFC events continues to grow, reflecting the sport’s rising global popularity.

These findings can inform athlete training, match prediction models, and viewer engagement strategies for stakeholders in the MMA ecosystem.
